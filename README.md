# Testing Repo

This repository contains a simple notepad web app. Open `index.html` in your web browser and begin typing to save notes. Your text is automatically stored in the browser so you can return to the page later and continue where you left off. The layout now adapts better to small screens so you can comfortably use it on phones and tablets. A small bullet button lets you toggle a ‚Ä¢ bullet at the start of each selected line.

## Hosting with GitHub Pages

If you want to use the notepad directly from GitHub, enable GitHub Pages for this repository. Make sure your main HTML file is named `index.html` and lives in the root of the branch you deploy. Then follow these steps:

1. Commit and push your code to GitHub.
2. On GitHub, open **Settings** ‚Üí **Pages**.
3. Under **Source**, choose **Deploy from a branch** and select your branch (usually `main`) with the root folder.
4. Click **Save** (or **Save changes**). GitHub will display the new Pages URL near the top of the screen.

After a few moments, visit that URL to see the notepad hosted online.

## Syncing Across Devices

The notepad stores data in your browser by default. To share notes between different browsers or devices without running a server, add your Supabase credentials to `index.html`.
Set `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` to the values from your project and the page will read and write the `notes` table automatically.

You can still run the Node.js server if you want a local `notes.txt` copy or to access the Gemini endpoint. It requires **Node.js 18 or newer**:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

To run the automated tests:

```bash
npm test
```

## Persistent Storage for `notes.txt`

The Node.js backend saves notes in a file called `notes.txt` at the project root. When this file is lost, so are your notes. Local development keeps the file on disk, but most hosting providers reset the filesystem on each deploy or restart.

If you want to keep notes when deploying to a platform like Render or Heroku, make sure the file is stored on persistent storage. On Render you can attach a disk in your service settings and mount it into the app directory so `notes.txt` survives restarts. Heroku doesn't preserve local files, so use an add-on such as Postgres or an S3 bucket and modify the server to write there instead. Any storage backend that persists between deployments will work.

## Supabase Setup

Create a Supabase project and a table named `notes` with columns
`id` (integer, primary key) and `content` (text). Copy your project's
**URL** and **anon** API key.

Edit `index.html` and set `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` to those
values. Once configured, the notepad automatically stores its text in the
`notes` table. The **Save to Cloud** (üíæ) and **Restore from Cloud** (‚¨áÔ∏è)
buttons also use these credentials to push or pull the latest text.
