# Testing Repo

This repository contains a simple notepad web app. Open `index.html` in your web
browser and begin typing to save notes. Your text is automatically stored in the
browser so you can return to the page later and continue where you left off.

## Hosting with GitHub Pages

If you want to use the notepad directly from GitHub, enable GitHub Pages for this
repository. Make sure your main HTML file is named `index.html` and lives in the
root of the branch you deploy. Then follow these steps:

1. Commit and push your code to GitHub.
2. On GitHub, open **Settings** â†’ **Pages**.
3. Under **Source**, choose **Deploy from a branch** and select your branch
   (usually `main`) with the root folder.
4. Click **Save** (or **Save changes**). GitHub will display the new Pages URL
   near the top of the screen.

After a few moments, visit that URL to see the notepad hosted online.

## Syncing Across Devices

The notepad stores data in your browser by default. To share notes between
different browsers or devices, run the included Node.js server:

```bash
npm install express cors
node server.js

```

## Box Breathing Page

Try the new box breathing exercise by opening `breathing.html`. Each phase lasts four seconds and the square changes to guide your breathing rhythm.
